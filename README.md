# jxls1.0.6

This version was used originally used in owlcms2.  The binaries for net.sf.jxls are still available on Maven Central.
The source was recovered from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jxls/files/jxls/1.0.6/

The new jxls 2.6 version at http://jxls.sourceforge.net/ would require too much work to adapt, so we kept the same code in owlcms4
